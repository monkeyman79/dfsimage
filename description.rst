**BBC Micro Acorn DFS floppy disk image maintenance utility**

This package is a command-line utility and a Python module dedicated for
maintenance of BBC Micro disk image files. Those files usually have extensions
`.ssd` - for single sided disk image, or `.dsd` - for double sided disk image.

This package allows indexing contents of the disk images, importing files to and
exporting from the disk images and modifying disk images in place, such as
renaming files or changing disk title.
